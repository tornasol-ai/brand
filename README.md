# Tornasol Flower

## Formula

$$
x(t) = R \cos(t) + a \cos(nt)
$$

$$
y(t) = R \sin(t) + a \sin(nt)
$$

where

$$
t \in [0, 2\pi]
$$

The curve is the sum of two circular motions at different speeds.

The first term, $R\cos(t)$ and $R\sin(t)$, traces a circle. The second term, $a\cos(nt)$ and $a\sin(nt)$, adds a smaller circular motion that completes $n$ full rotations for every one rotation of the main circle.

When $a$ is small, this just wobbles the circle. But when $a > R/n$, the perturbation is strong enough that the curve doubles back on itself, creating self-intersecting loops that curl inward. With $n = 5$ and $a = 0.55$, you get five petal-like loops evenly spaced around the circle.
